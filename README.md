# Wonderlst

 Trello App Clone created using Ruby on Rails 

 Used as a quick review for RoR , my favorite programming language <3

## Instructions to create App 

* This is for creating you app in your local environment , so ensure that you have compatible versions of RoR installed locally

* rails new Wonderlst 

* bundle install : goes into http://rubygems.org/ to fetch ruby gems which you can think of as prepackaged solutions that you can plugin  
  to your application that are open to a range of functionalities. (installs the basic gems that any RoR app would need to get started)

* Basic Rails Architecture : MVC (Model , View , Controller)

* Model : maintains the relationship between Object and Database , and handles the validations, associations and transactions

* View : html.erb (HTML), hence what is visible to the client. A presentation of data in a particular format , TRIGGERED by a controller's 
         decision to present the data

* Controller : the controller directs the traffic of an application. On one hand it queries the model for specific data , and on the other hand 
               it organizes this data (searching , sorting , etc.) in a form that fits the needs of the associated VIEW. Controller is el MAESTRO.
